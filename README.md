# Hi!!! 🐈 I'm Salem!

## Introduction! 😺
Currently, I'm studying web design and development. I also love creating art of many types. Many of my favorite personal projects involve combining aspects of my artistic passion into my web designs.

In fact, I find that web development is not only an important platform for finding and sharing information on the Internet, but also an incredibly fun medium for art projects such as interactive puzzles, writing, community building, and more. Every time I ask "what can I do with this technology?" the answer only gets longer. I'm excited to be learning and expanding my skillset more and more every day, both when it comes to professional projects and my hobbies.

## My Skills! 😼
- I'm great at both HTML and CSS.
- I'm proficient at JavaScript (but there's always more to learn!)
    - I'm familiar with jQuery and always breathe a little sigh of relief whenever I can use it. 
- I'm also proficient with C++!
